# Mood-Detection & Emotion-Aware-Chatbot

A real-time, empathetic chatbot that uses computer vision to detect and respond to a user's emotional state. This project features two distinct applications: a web-based interface and a desktop GUI.

## Problem Statement
Human-computer interaction is becoming more sophisticated, requiring systems to be contextually aware and emotionally intelligent. This project addresses the need for an interactive agent that can understand a user's mood through facial expressions. The goal is to provide supportive, personalized responses, fostering a more natural and engaging user experience.

## Dataset
* **Model:** Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (`emotiondetector.h5`) for facial emotion recognition.
* **Source:** Trained on a public dataset of facial expressions (e.g., FER-2013).

## Methods & Tools
* **AI Model (Keras/TensorFlow)**
    * A CNN model is used for real-time facial emotion detection.
* **Data Processing (Python - OpenCV)**
    * Captures video from a webcam.
    * Uses Haar Cascades for efficient face detection.
    * Pre-processes face images to feed into the model.
* **Chatbot Logic (Python)**
    * `ChatBot` class with pre-defined, emotion-specific responses.
    * Logic to cycle through responses to avoid repetition.
* **User Interface**
    * **Web Application:** Built with **FastAPI**, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Uses WebSockets for live updates.
    * **Desktop Application:** A standalone GUI built with **Tkinter** for a native experience.

## Key Insights
* The chatbot successfully interprets seven key emotions: happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust, neutral, and surprise.
* The response logic provides dynamic and supportive feedback tailored to the user's mood.
* The dual interface (web and desktop) demonstrates flexibility in deployment and user access.

How to Run the Project
Desktop Application
This project is configured to run the desktop application from the root directory.

Clone Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/mood-detection-chatbot.git](https://github.com/yourusername/mood-detection-chatbot.git)
cd mood-detection-chatbot
Install Python Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Application:

Bash

python app_copy.py
Web Application
The web application requires a specific folder structure to run correctly. You can create the necessary static/ and templates/ folders locally and place your HTML files accordingly.

Clone and Install Dependencies: Follow steps 1-2 from the "Desktop Application" section.

Organize Files: Create a templates/ folder and move index.html, login.html, and signup.html into it.

Run the FastAPI Server:

Bash

uvicorn app:app --reload
Future Improvements
Add a feature to train the model with new data.

Integrate a conversational AI model (e.g., using Hugging Face Transformers) for more natural and free-form dialogue.

Create a user profile to track and visualize mood history over time.

Deploy the web application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
